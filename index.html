My email address is s3637291@student.rmit.edu.au. Before entering the university, I only completed my high school study in China. People in my hometown like spicy food as much as I do. Besides, I usually enjoy traveling, singing and playing all kinds of online games in daily life.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>IT is everywhere in our life. Search engines on computers could help people get information faster. They could also watch any video online. These advanced applications are gradually making their way into smaller phones. Our life is becoming more convenient. In addition, I've seen many games grow in terms of graphics and other experiences. Online communication and mobile payments are also incredible to me. All of these developments and innovations happened in a short period of time. I think the future development of this industry is very broad and it may bring more changes to human life. I was intrigued when I first came across personal computers in 2007. It was like opening the door to a new world. My father used spreadsheets early on to keep track of company bills. I thought it would replace paper and pens and it could be easier to save or modify. My previous courses did not include any information technology related knowledge so I did not have any experiences in this field. At the same time, I hope I could gain some new skills in university.</p>

									<p>As for my choice of university, I was studying in an international high school of China at that time. There are so many classmates would study abroad with me. We believe that RMIT's reputation, including teaching quality, employment and learning resources are highly regarded by the outside world. I chose this school first because there are some friends I know. The other thing is that the location is so convenient. Studying in downtown Melbourne is like living in Beijing. There are some similarities in style between the two cities. Moreover, I think as long as you can choose your favorite major, then the school is not so important.

I mentioned before that I haven't taken any courses in this field so I want to start with my own interests. I'm curious about software development on smartphones because it's really simplifying people's lives over time. For this point, I prefer to learn practical methods rather than pure theoretical knowledge. On the other hand, I also want to work on game-related programs. This is one of the everyday activities that many young people, including me, enjoy so I want to learn and improve the experience it will bring to players in the future.

Personally, I just finished high school. Once I learned some basic knowledge related to higher mathematics, but these should not meet the requirements. This year is the beginning of my undergraduate study in information technology, so I just started to learn programming language recently. In addition, The actual work experience is not relevant to the current industry.</p>

									<p>From my present situation, the requirements of this job are almost impossible to meet .I could only start with what I can do. In fact, I still feel the teacher's pace is a little fast through the experience of these weeks. I'm like a novice at nothing, but I'm still looking for ways to improve. First, I will go to the library to borrow some books related to programming language and practice the examples in them. In class, I often communicate with some experienced classmates or ask for help because many of them had a background in programming. Next, I'm studying on websites like codecademy. This includes theoretical explanations and related practice opportunities. At the same time, I also want to try my best to complete my professional tasks. Maybe they are very simple for most students, but I lack basic knowledge and practice. As a result, I could only explore and solve these problems by myself. At present, I could not think of any more ways to change the status, so I hope these attempts may help me master the basic concepts and application of programming language.</p>

									<p>Confident (in own ability to succeed)
This trait measures the extent to which you are confident in your ability to accomplish and achieve challenging tasks in the workplace. This trait assists employers to learn about your self-confidence in your ability to manage and outperform in the role. Self-confidence is one of the most important indicators for success in the workplace. Therefore, most employers regard it as one of the most important factors in making a selection decision.

Your result implies that you generally believe in your ability to manage and accomplish projects and tasks. This belief, however, is not unlimited. You may sometimes feel lacking in confidence or ineffective in your abilities to accomplish goals in the workplace.</p>

									<p>Achievement Driven
This trait measures the extent to which you strive to achieve excellence and accomplish your goals. This trait assists employers to learn about your inner drive and ambition for excellence in the role. Employers are interested in taking onboard people who have an ambition to excel in what they do. It reassures the employer that you will invest all your efforts to achieve your work-related goals. Although some do not look favourably upon people with an extreme drive for excellence, most employers do.

Your result indicates that you are likely to have an inner drive and ambition to do your best to achieve successful outcomes in the workplace. Nevertheless, you are more interested in completing the tasks assigned to you than achieving excellence in what you do. It doesn’t mean that you will not invest effort and energy to accomplish the task at hand; it only means that your priority is to get it done well rather than to achieve the best result that you can.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Answer</h2>
									<p>As an introvert, I have always been accustomed to paying attention to my own opinions and immersing myself in the personal world. This means it's easy for me to ignore outside information or other people's feelings. I also like to explore the big picture rather than the details of everything. In fact, the big picture could help people see the root of things, but the details of the components are just as important. Sometimes I prioritize the needs of others because I want to foster relationships by understanding them. Besides, I don't naturally like to be bound by rules, but our lives are full of them. I like the casual life style because it could bring relaxation to people. In terms of learning, I prefer some real and visual information because it is more intuitive and easy to attract my attention.</p>

I personally understand that team work should consist of discussing and helping each other. On the contrary, my personality encourages me to be relatively passive. Even though I have many thoughts in my mind, I don't give priority to them. This makes it difficult for me to fit in because I always wait for others to speak first. On the other hand, I naturally think that I am not as capable as others, but I believe that I could finish some basic work smoothly. This caused me to always wait for instructions on some basic task rather than challenge some innovation alone. Due to my lack of confidence, I will lose many opportunities and attempts, so I cannot highlight my due value in the team.</p>

For example, in the process of discussion, I could fully express my own views and give comments on the views of others. Confidence is also something I need to improve. I should have a correct understanding of myself in terms of ability. Take the initiative to use what you are good at and learn more about what you are not good at. Communication and understanding are very important in a team, so I need to adjust myself and attach importance to cooperation with other team members.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Project ideas</h2>
									<p>Since the appearance of smart phone, people's life is becoming more and more convenient and simple. My thoughts also start from life .I remember before that it was popular to use cell phones to control air conditioners in summer. This means that the mobile phone could replace the air conditioner remote control. Otherwise, there are still many appliances in our lives that require specific remote controls or switches. I hope to develop a mobile phone software as the control center of all household appliances. The systems and networks of these appliances are tied directly to the phone. They receive commands from the phone and change their status accordingly.</p>

									<p>In fact, everyone's home is full of light switches or remote controls. They require a certain amount of production cost and some of them require the use of batteries. We could avoid this waste entirely. Now some lights have inductive switches and it turns off automatically after a while. For this, our mobile phone could also achieve it through timing. Most importantly, it could replace all the control buttons. People don't need to look for specific switches or remote controls to give commands. Some appliances that need to be used at fixed times could also be automated by using the phone to set the time. In addition, people have such control even when they are not at home. More details will be explained in the next section.</p>

									<p>The control of this software receives instructions in two ways. The first is that we can normally use the phone touch the corresponding options. The second is artificial intelligence. Brands of smartphones now have their own artificial intelligence, which uses voice recognition to find software, information or run commands directly. In this process, we just need to say the name of the appliance we want to control and the action we want to achieve to the mobile phone. This progress makes it easier and more direct for people to control home appliances. In terms of security, I just assume that the phone can only recognize the voice of the user.</p>

									<p>Of course, the phone's fingerprint unlock and password is also a layer of protection. As for the setting of time, we can set a fixed switch period for each electrical appliance according to everyone's habit. This is similar to how we set our alarm clocks. The corresponding appliance will run automatically when it reaches the set time. The initial interface displays the switching state of all appliances. It is convenient for people to check the safety of home appliances because some appliances can damage themselves or waste energy if left on for a long time. On the other hand, each appliance is fitted with a dedicated scanning device that feeds back real-time state information. This is just my assumption because it's very difficult to achieve either cost or technical universality. </p>

									<p>For example, our TV sometimes fails to play or goes dark.The corresponding problem will be detected and immediately sent to the phone. Solutions to the problem are also listed. If it's a regular problem we can get the phone to fix itself. What's more interesting is that our refrigerator can also scan out the food types in each area and give Suggestions for the appropriate temperature. So people could set up their refrigerators to work anywhere, anytime. A miniature robot sweeping the floor at home can also be scanned regularly to see if there is a safety hazard. Each appliance provides the user with actual information about themselves or their home. Some lights are equipped with heat-sensing features to check if there are strangers or even small animals in the house. </p>

									<p>At the same time, the application ACTS as a data center. It records the purchase time, use time, continuous connection time and even product information including manufacturer and other basic information of each appliance. Each electrical appliance has the function of network connection because only in this way can the connection with the mobile phone be realized and the specific operation be realized. It's like a tiny connection point controlled by a cell phone. They also have different connections to their own manufacturing companies. Manufacturers will only know the purchase information and related usage data of their products. This makes it easier for them to test various types of data on the product and take action to improve it. If customers find any unsolvable problems with the products, they can follow the instructions and immediately contact the company. This allows for the fastest repair or purchase of new products.</p>

At the same time, we need to equip electrical appliances with network receivers to determine the communication between them and mobile phones. All instructions need to be converted on a fixed online platform. In addition, special detectors and temperature sensors needed for some electrical appliances should also be fully considered and tested. We also need to set up an online database to record information and changes. Finally, we need smartphones as control hubs to run this software.</p>

In addition, this work requires someone to establish the types of databases and count the status of various kinds of information.
